# Marketing-Research-Project

This is a marketing research project aim to help the owner of a Chinese restaurant in San Diego analyze the feasibility of expanding the business to the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). There are lots of uncertainties that need to be considered before implementing this plan. We had a brainstorm discussion using SWOT to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to this business expansion plan. Then, we held a focus group meeting to learn more details about people's preference. Finally, we built a questionnaire covering questions that directly answered marketing research problems, and used technical methods such as hypothesis testing and regression to explore trends and preferences of a broader audience, and made recommendations to the manage- ment.  

We mainly used R and Radiant to analyze the data collected.
